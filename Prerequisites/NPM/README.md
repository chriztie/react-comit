# Node Package Manager

NPM is considered the worlds largest collection of packages. Both open source and private packages are stored.

Common commands are as follows:

`npm init` initializes a new application and based on the answers provided for the prompted questions, a package.json file is generated

`npm install <packageName> ` installs the package bearing name `<packageName>` to the application

`npm uninstall <packageName>` uninstalls the package bearing name `<packageName>` from the application

`npm start` starts the application

`npm build` builds the application

`npm test` runs all the tests in the application

`npm <packageName>` runs the package, `npx <packageName>` runs the latest version ignoring the version installed locally
