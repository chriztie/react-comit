3. Display the all the properties of the object in your component
4. Modify the component to display the name and calculate whether you were born in Canada or not based on properties in the object. (you may use `new Date().getFullYear()` to get the current year)
5. Add an inline style and change the color of all the text to green and align text to center of the screen
6. Create a function component to display a list of student profiles
