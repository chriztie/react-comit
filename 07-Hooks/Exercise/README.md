1. Add a form (text boxes to store name, age and city) to your main component and store all the values using `useState` and display all the contents of your form, using labels. Make sure the labels get updated when user types in details.
2. Using context API create a context to store the logged in user name in your main app component and refer the same in a child component.
3. Introduce a method to your context to add a changehandler which can change the context and call the changehandler in your child component.
