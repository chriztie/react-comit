# Introduction

A JavaScript library (**NOT** a Framework like Angular/Amber) to build user interfaces created by Facebook in 2011 for Facebook. And it is now used in Instagram and a lot of other web applications.

## Why React?

Developed to create user interfaces for web applications. It's fast! Flexible and used by Facebook and won't go away anytime soon! You can build Static, Dynamic and Single Page Applications (SPAs)

## Basic Concepts and Architecture

React is a component library which means it is a collection of components. 
It is faster compared to other libraries and architectures due to its optimized DOM manipulation. 
Easily pluggable and enables gradual migration.

Innovated JSX (which enabled writing html in JS files) and virtual DOM (which minimizes expensive DOM updates)

## Other Usages

- React Native for mobile applications
- React VR for Virtual Reality applications
- Gatsby for Desktop applications
- NEXT.js for Server rendered applications

## CodeMods

Mechanism React handles backward compatibility

## Size of React

The minified and gzipped size is 35k and there are alternatives like Inferno and Preact if size is a concern
